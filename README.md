# Password Generator

## Description

This project was to create an easy to use random password generator. This project uses advanced javascript to help generate password to users criteria through a series of prompts. Once criteria is entered, generated password will appear on page with an easy copy text button to copy new password to users clipboard.

This project helped me learn how functions and prompts in javascripts. More precisely, how to use a function to return or value or change a global parameter, as well as call another function.
